        <h3>Software Development</h3>
        <p>I love writing code and working on cool new projects using any of the languages that I am familiar with, like C, C#, Java and System Verilog. I've had plenty of exposure to software engineer through my coursework in school, as well as my
          past internships and current software engineering postion. My dream is to be able to create my own website from scratch, and develop my own app!</p>

        <h3>Firmware Engineering</h3>
        <p>I've done a lot of hardware related coding projects, anywhere from digital logic design using verilog on an FPGA board, to creating an RFID Entry system on a microcontroller based framework to creating my own single core and multi-core
          processor with caching. My years of progress being a computer engineering student has allowed me to partake in the realm of low-level computer architecture and working as closely as possible to the computer hardware.</p>
